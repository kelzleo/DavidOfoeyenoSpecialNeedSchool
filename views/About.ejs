                <p>CDOSSC was commissioned by Dr. Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa, then Governor of Delta State. It is well recognized by the government. We engage students in many educational and recreational activities. This helps them fit into society with as much knowledge and skills as possible.</p>

                <h2>PROFESSIONAL AFFILIATIONS</h2>
                <p>The educational institution is dedicated to creating a supportive and secure setting specifically designed for students attending special schools. Within this environment, children and young adults can forge social connections while benefitting from individualized attention, facilitated by low student-to-teacher ratios. CDOSSC is committed to maximizing the growth of each student's communication and language, social, academic, and life/independence skills, recognizing the unique needs of those attending special schools. Our overarching goal is to foster independence among students with diverse abilities, enabling them to actively participate and thrive within their communities, all within the specialized framework of special education.</p>
